We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on their servers.

Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.

Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us.
